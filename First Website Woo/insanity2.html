  A white room. <br>
  No windows, no doors. <br>
  The roomâ€™s walls, ceiling, and floor meet each other in exceptionally hard edges. <br>
  The room is uniformly bright, but there is no visible light source. <br>
  The room is one of many identical rooms. <br>
  The exact number is unknown, unknowable, and constantly changing. <br>
  The configuration of the rooms is also constantly changing. <br>
  The reconfiguration of the rooms does not follow the usual rules. <br>
  For example, a room may exist in the middle of the assemblage one moment and the edge the next, <br>
  having jumped there seemingly by time travel. <br>
  The occupants of the rooms are unknown. <br>
  Some of the rooms would appear to have no occupants. <br>
  The overall location of the network of rooms is unknown, and is also changing. <br>
  The rooms exist in a vacuum. <br>
  The rooms exist only in your consciousness. <br>
  The rooms also exist in the collective consciousness of the entire universe. <br>
