  <marquee direction=left scrollamount=20>I need to collect things. I need to sort things. I need to systemize information. <br></marquee>
<marquee direction=right scrollamount=18>  My entire being is devoted to this end. It is why I code, why I write, why I make art, why I read, why I listen to music, why I speak, why I research, why I think. <br></marquee>
  <marquee direction=left scrollamount=16>It's also why I play Tetris. I love tetris. I love how the little shapes can be sorted into such nicely interlocking pieces. <br></marquee>
  <marquee direction=right scrollamount=14>If only I were more interested in theoretical mathematics or particle physics or chemistry.<br></marquee>
  <marquee direction=left scrollamount=12>I could really make some breakthroughs if I thought more about how equations or atoms fit together.<br></marquee>
<marquee direction=right scrollamount=10>  Well...I guess the only thing left to do is figure out the second best type of information to sort through. <br></marquee>
<marquee direction=left scrollamount=8>  Because some information is more valuable than other information. Or is it?  </marquee>
